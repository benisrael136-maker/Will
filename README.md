This is a brief, unique, and error-free Clarity contract for fair Request for Proposal (RFP) bidding on Web3.
It allows owners to create RFPs, vendors to commit hashed proposals, later reveal proposals with salt, and finally lets the owner finalize and immutably record the winner.
Features: commit–reveal security, on-chain winner recording, and compact design (<25 lines).
